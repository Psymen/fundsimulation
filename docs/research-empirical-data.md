## 8. Fund Size vs Returns

### Core Finding: Small Funds Outperform

**Fund Size Performance (2017-2021 Vintages):**

**$1M-$10M Funds:**
- Better returns than $100M+ funds across most thresholds
- **Source:** [Carta: Small VC Funds Outperform Large Funds](https://carta.com/data/vc-fund-size-performance-2024/)
- **Date:** 2024 analysis

**Funds < $350M:**

### Why Smaller Funds Outperform

**Mathematical Constraints:**

**$30M Fund:**
- Can achieve 3-5x with a few $100M-$200M exits
- Feasible outcome distribution

**$1B Fund:**
- Needs multiple $10B+ outcomes to move the needle
- Such exits are exceedingly rare
- **Source:** [7BC: Why Smaller VC Funds Outperform](https://www.7bc.vc/blog/smaller-vcs-outperform)

**Late-Stage Pricing Compression:**
- Mega-funds write $25M-$150M checks
- Entry prices closer to realistic exit values
- Many struggle to return even 1x after 10+ years
- **Source:** [7BC: Why Smaller VC Funds Outperform](https://www.7bc.vc/blog/smaller-vcs-outperform)

### Capital Concentration Despite Performance

**2024 Market Dynamics:**

## 9. Optimal Portfolio Size and Diversification

### Standard Portfolio Size Recommendations

**Most Common Range:**
- **20-30 investments** for most VC funds
- Balances risk and provides adequate diversification
- **Source:** [VC Guide to Portfolio Construction](https://www.goingvc.com/post/a-vcs-guide-to-portfolio-construction)

### Returns by Portfolio Size and Check Size

**Smaller Checks (£150K-£2M):**
- **30 investments** delivers biggest jump in returns
- **Source:** [SyndicateRoom: Beating the Dragons](https://www.syndicateroom.com/guides-and-reports/how-to-outperform-vcs)

**Larger Checks (£500K-£5M):**
- Upward trend continues PAST 30 companies
- More diversification = greater likelihood of high returns
- **Source:** [SyndicateRoom: Beating the Dragons](https://www.syndicateroom.com/guides-and-reports/how-to-outperform-vcs)

### Power Law Requires Diversification

**Why More Is Better:**
- VC returns follow power law (few winners drive all returns)
- Portfolios must be large enough to capture outliers
- **30+ investments** tend to perform better
- **Source:** [Understanding VC Portfolio Construction](https://rundit.com/blog/what-is-vc-fund-portfolio-construction/)

**Limited Diversification Risk:**
- **20-company portfolio:** Only 9% chance of achieving 5x return
- **Source:** [OpenVC: How to Build a VC Portfolio](https://www.openvc.app/blog/how-to-build-a-vc-portfolio-that-performs)

### Early-Stage Recommendations

**100+ Company Portfolios:**
- Reduces risk of losing investor money
- Increases odds of capturing outliers
- **Source:** [OpenVC: How to Build a VC Portfolio](https://www.openvc.app/blog/how-to-build-a-vc-portfolio-that-performs)

### Portfolio Construction Principles

**Stage Considerations:**
- **Earlier-stage funds:** Less concentrated (more companies)
- **Reason:** Wider distribution of outcomes at seed/early stage

**Fund Size Considerations:**
- **Smaller funds:** Less concentrated (more companies)
- **Reason:** Lack ability to continue investing across rounds

## 10. Fee Structure Data (2024)

### The 2/20 Standard

**Industry Standard:**
- **2%** annual management fee
- **20%** carried interest (carry)
- Remains dominant structure for VC and hedge funds
- **Source:** [Two and Twenty VC Fee Structure](https://qubit.capital/blog/two-and-twenty-vc-fee-structure)

**Typical Range:**
- **1.0% - 2.5%** per annum of committed capital
- **2%** has become market anchor
- Smaller funds sometimes charge higher (up to 2.5%)
- **Source:** [VC Fees and Carry](https://venturepatterns.com/blog/vc/vc-fees-and-carry/)

**Step-Down Provisions:**
- After investment period ends: fees often drop to **1.5%** or **1%**
- Reflects shift from active investing to portfolio management
- **Source:** [Understanding VC Fund Mechanics](https://blackinvestor360.com/2025/07/08/vc-fund-mechanics-management-fees-and-carry-explained/)

### Carried Interest Variations

**Typical Range:**
- **15% - 30%** across venture funds
- **20%** is median and most common
- **Inverse Correlation:** Higher fees → lower carry; Lower fees → higher carry
- **Source:** [VC Fees Explained](https://multiple.substack.com/p/venture-capital-fees-explained-what)

- **20%** carried interest remains median across VC funds
- **Source:** [TechCrunch: Not All VC Firms Use 2-and-20](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/venture-fund-2-and-20/)
- **Date:** 2023-2024

### GP Commitment

**Market Standard:**
- **Median GP Commitment:** 1.7% of fund size
- Represents increasing capital burden, especially for smaller funds
- **Source:** [VC Fees Explained](https://multiple.substack.com/p/venture-capital-fees-explained-what)

### Hurdle Rates (Preferred Return)

**Definition:**
- Minimum return fund must achieve before GP receives carry

**Typical Structures:**

**IRR-Based Hurdle:**
- **6% - 10%** per annum (cumulative, compounding)

**Multiple-Based Hurdle:**
- **1.20x - 1.25x** MOIC
- **Source:** [Understanding VC Fund Mechanics](https://blackinvestor360.com/2025/07/08/vc-fund-mechanics-management-fees-and-carry-explained/)

### Distribution Waterfall Structures

**European Waterfall (Total Fund):**
- All cash first repays LP capital + preferred return
- THEN carry flows to GP
- **More common for early-stage VC**
- **Source:** [American vs European Waterfall](https://qubit.capital/blog/american-vs-european-waterfall)

**American Waterfall (Deal-by-Deal):**
- Calculated on per-deal basis
- GP compensated for each successful deal
- GP receives carry earlier in fund life
- **More common for late-stage PE**
- Includes clawback provisions
- **Source:** [How Distribution Waterfalls Work](https://carta.com/learn/private-funds/management/distribution-waterfall/)

**GP Catch-Up:**
- GP receives 100% of incremental proceeds after preferred return
- Continues until GP's share equals agreed carry % (typically 20%)
- Final split: 80/20 LP/GP
- **Common when preferred return exists**

## 11. J-Curve and Cash Flow Pacing

### The Takahashi-Alexander Model

**Background:**
- Developed in 2001 by Dean Takahashi & Seth Alexander (Yale Investments Office)
- Deterministic model for estimating future cash flows and valuations
- Still commonly used by investors today
- **Source:** [Takahashi-Alexander Model: A Practical Guide](https://tamarix.tech/insights/the-takahashi-alexander-model-a-practical-guide)

**Core Model Inputs:**
- Rate of contribution
- Capital commitment
- Life of fund
- Factor describing changes in distribution rate over time
- Annual growth rate
- Yield
- **Source:** [Christoph Jaeckel: The Takahashi and Alexander Model](https://www.christoph-jaeckel.com/posts/2023-02-05-the-takahashi-and-alexander-model/)

**Model Limitations:**

- Fails to provide range of possible outcomes
- Can lead to overconfidence in forecasts
- **Source:** [Harvard Business School: Takahashi-Alexander Revisited](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64173)

### The J-Curve Pattern

**Shape and Duration:**
- Value dips in first few years (capital called, fees paid, no returns yet)
- Transitions to positive as distributions become prominent
- Cumulative net cash flows: negative → positive over time
- **Source:** [The Private Equity Pacing Model](https://www.allvuesystems.com/resources/the-private-equity-pacing-model-3-key-challenges-investors-face/)

### Capital Call Pacing

**Notice Period:**
- **Typical:** 7-30 days notice for capital calls
- **Common:** 10-14 days for investors to transfer funds
- **Source:** [What is a Capital Call](https://carta.com/learn/private-funds/management/capital-calls/)

**Deployment Timeline:**

## 14. Critical Caveats and Limitations

### Survivorship Bias

- Performance benchmarks often exclude failed or zombie funds
- True performance distribution may be worse than published data
- Particularly affects older vintage data where only survivors report

### Vintage Year Maturity

- **Cambridge Associates:** Most funds take 6+ years to settle into final quartile
- Performance metrics for vintages 2018+ are still evolving
- Early performance may not predict final returns

### Mark-to-Market Uncertainty

- TVPI includes unrealized valuations (subject to change)
- 2021-2022 vintages likely carrying inflated marks
- DPI is more reliable but lags significantly (especially for young vintages)
- Only 14.2% of companies had valuation changes in 2024 (AngelList)

### Market Regime Changes

- **2021-2022:** Peak valuations, easy funding, ZIRP environment
- **2022-2023:** Rate hikes, valuation compression, funding drought
- **2024-2025:** Recovery with AI-driven bifurcation
- Historical patterns may not apply to recent vintages

### AI-Driven Skew

- 2024-2025 data heavily influenced by AI mega-rounds
- 33-58% of capital flowing to AI creates non-representative sample
- Traditional sector benchmarks may not apply

### Self-Selection in Reported Data

- Top-performing funds more likely to share data
- Struggling funds less likely to report
- Platform data (Carta, AngelList) may skew toward tech-forward companies

### Geographic and Sector Concentration

- Most data US-centric
- Heavy concentration in software/tech
- Life sciences, hardware, other sectors underrepresented

## 15. Recommended Simulation Parameters

Based on this research, here are recommended parameter ranges for Monte Carlo simulation calibration:

### Exit Outcome Distribution (Power Law)

**Suggested Distribution:**
- **0x return:** 30-40% of companies (total loss)
- **0.1-0.5x:** 15-20% (partial loss)
- **0.5-1x:** 10-15% (near break-even)
- **1-3x:** 15-20% (modest success)
- **3-5x:** 8-10% (good return)
- **5-10x:** 4-6% (strong return)
- **10x+:** 2-4% (home run)

**Data Support:**
- 65% fail to return 1x
- Only 10% return 5x+
- Only 4-6% return 10x+

### Exit Timing by Stage

**Seed/Early Stage:**
- **Mean:** 8 years
- **Range:** 4-12 years
- **Distribution:** Right-skewed (long tail)

**Series A/B:**
- **Mean:** 6-7 years
- **Range:** 3-10 years

**Late Stage:**
- **Mean:** 4-5 years
- **Range:** 2-8 years

**IPO vs M&A:**
- **M&A:** 65% of exits, ~5 years average
- **IPO:** 35% of exits, ~7 years average

### Fund-Level Returns by Quartile (10-Year Horizon)

**Top Quartile:**
- **TVPI:** 3.0x - 5.0x
- **IRR:** 15% - 25%
- **DPI:** 2.0x - 3.5x (at year 10)

**Median:**
- **TVPI:** 2.0x - 2.5x
- **IRR:** 12% - 15%
- **DPI:** 1.3x - 1.8x (at year 10)

**Bottom Quartile:**
- **TVPI:** 0.8x - 1.5x
- **IRR:** 0% - 8%
- **DPI:** 0.5x - 1.0x (at year 10)

### Fee Structure (Base Case)

- **Management Fee:** 2% per annum on committed capital
- **Step-Down:** 1.5% after year 5 (post-investment period)
- **Carried Interest:** 20%
- **Hurdle Rate:** 8% IRR (preferred return)
- **GP Catch-Up:** Yes (to 20% total)
- **Waterfall:** European (whole fund) for early-stage

### Capital Deployment Pacing

**Years 1-3:**
- **50-60%** of committed capital called
- **Quarterly calls** of 4-8% each

**Years 4-5:**
- **20-30%** of committed capital called
- **Follow-on focused**

**Years 6-10:**
- **Remaining 10-20%** for opportunistic follow-on
- **Reserve deployment**

### Reserve Allocation Strategy

- **Initial Portfolio:** 40% of fund (e.g., 20-30 companies)
- **Follow-On Reserve:** 60% of fund
- **Winners Allocation:** 50% of reserve → top 25% performers
- **Pro-Rata Participation:** 78% probability for each company raising next round

### Portfolio Construction

**Fund Size < $100M:**
- **25-40 companies** (more diversification)
- **Target:** Higher probability of 3x+ return

**Fund Size $100M-$500M:**
- **20-30 companies** (balanced approach)

**Fund Size > $500M:**
- **15-25 companies** (more concentrated)
- **Caveat:** Math gets harder; may underperform smaller funds

### DPI/TVPI Realization Curve

**Year 3:** DPI = 5-10% of TVPI
**Year 5:** DPI = 15-25% of TVPI
**Year 7:** DPI = 35-50% of TVPI
**Year 10:** DPI = 60-75% of TVPI
**Year 12+:** DPI = 80-95% of TVPI

**2024 Market:** DPI/TVPI = 11% (historically low due to exit drought)

### Stage-Specific Adjustments

**Seed Stage:**
- Higher failure rate (38.6%)
- Lower initial check size
- Longer time to exit (8+ years)
- Need more portfolio companies (30-50)

**Series A/B:**
- Moderate failure rate (20-25%)
- Balanced risk/return
- Standard portfolio size (20-30)

**Late Stage/Growth:**
- Lower failure rate (10-15%)
- Lower multiples on entry (1.5-2.5x)
- Shorter time to exit (4-5 years)
- More concentrated portfolios (10-20)

### 2024-2025 Market Adjustments

**AI Sector:**
- +42% valuation premium at seed
- +100% valuation premium at Series C
- May warrant higher exit multiples in simulation

**Non-AI Sectors:**
- Use conservative multiples
- Longer time to exit
- Higher failure rates

**Valuation Compression Cohort (2021-2022 Investments):**
- Reduce expected TVPI by 15-30%
- Longer holding periods
- Higher risk of down rounds or flat exits

## 16. Research Methodology Notes

**Search Strategy:**
- Focused on 2024-2025 data with allowance for 2023 where recent data unavailable
- Prioritized institutional sources (Cambridge Associates, Carta, PitchBook-NVCA)
- Cross-referenced multiple sources for key metrics
- Noted publication dates and data vintages

**Data Reliability:**
- Highest confidence: Cambridge Associates, Carta platform data
- Medium confidence: AngelList platform data (self-selection bias)
- Context-dependent: Promotional materials, individual VC blogs
- All sources cited with URLs for verification

**Gaps Identified:**
- Limited granular data on 2019-2020 vintage performance
- Sparse data on non-US markets
- Limited public data on fund-level failures
- Most recent vintages (2022+) too young for meaningful metrics
